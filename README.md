# Quantum Traffic Optimizer 🚦⚛️

A quantum-enhanced adaptive urban traffic signal optimization system utilizing QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) and QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) coupled with SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility).

---

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Microscopic Traffic Simulation with SUMO**:
   - Realistic 2x2 multi-intersection urban grid with bidirectional multilane arterials.
   - The bundled SUMO network contains four signalized intersections (`I1`-`I4`).
   - TraCI integration (`SUMOAdapter` & `SimulationOrchestrator`) with automated fallback simulator for headless testing.
   - Real-time vehicle tracking, waiting times, queue lengths, and throughput calculation.

2. **Network-Aware QUBO & Ising Formulation**:
   - **Queue Pressure Minimization**: Penalizes long standing queues across North-South and East-West corridors.
   - **Emergency Green Waves**: Prioritizes emergency vehicles (ambulances/fire engines) with immediate preemption and green corridor routing.
   - **Network Coordination (Green Wave Coupling)**: Rewards synchronized green phases between adjacent intersections along primary traffic corridors.
   - **Phase Switching Stability**: Adds inertia penalties to prevent excessive switching and maintain traffic momentum.
   - Exact mathematical conversion between binary variables $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$ and Pauli-$Z$ spins $\sigma_z \in \{-1, +1\}$.

3. **QAOA Quantum Optimization Engine**:
   - Parameterized quantum circuits evaluated on Qiskit Aer Statevector and QASM simulators with COBYLA classical optimization.
   - Optimal phase and green duration selection (`30`, `60`, or `90` seconds) across the configured intersections.
   - Probability distribution visualization and bitstring convergence tracking.

4. **Dual Controller Benchmarking**:
   - **Quantum Controller (`QuantumOptimizerController`)**: Evaluates real-time network states, compiles dynamic QUBO/Ising models, solves via QAOA, and actuates traffic lights.
   - **Classical Controller (`ClassicalRuleBasedController`)**: Baseline rule-based controller for rigorous comparative benchmarking.

5. **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)**:
   - **Benchmark Comparison**: Side-by-side performance comparison of classical vs. QAOA optimization (delay, queue length, throughput, emergency clearance).
   - **QAOA & QUBO Deep Dive**: Cost matrix visualization, Pauli-$Z$ Hamiltonian inspection, parameter convergence ($\gamma, \beta$), and measurement state probabilities.
   - **Live Network Topology**: Visual 2x2 grid representing intersections I1–I4, active phases, queue pressures, and emergency vehicle corridors.
   - **Detailed Benchmark Results**: Tabular and graphical breakdowns across time steps.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meghna2508/Quantum-traffic-optimizer.git
cd Quantum-traffic-optimizer
git checkout quantum-optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or install qiskit qiskit-aer streamlit traci pytest
```

Install Eclipse SUMO separately and add its `bin` directory to `PATH`. On Windows, SUMO can be installed with:

```powershell
winget install --id EclipseFoundation.SUMO --exact
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
pytest
```
The test suite validates network state snapshots, QUBO generation, Ising mapping, QAOA convergence, emissions scoring, and SUMO TraCI adapters.

### 3. Launch Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
View the live dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 4. Run Hackathon Demo
```bash
python run_hackathon_demo.py
```

## Problem and Recent Improvements

The dashboard initially failed with `TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` because the installed Streamlit version did not accept `width="stretch"` for charts and dataframes. The dashboard now uses `use_container_width=True` for compatibility.

The original QUBO objective optimized queue length, waiting time, congestion, throughput, stability, downstream traffic, and emergency priority, but it did not explicitly account for emissions. This allowed the quantum controller to reduce queues while sometimes producing higher fuel consumption and CO2 than the classical controller.

The current implementation adds an emissions proxy to the QUBO cost model. It penalizes red-side idling, residual green-side queues, and traffic density. The configurable weights are:

- Congestion penalty: `8.0`
- Downstream penalty: `12.0`
- Emissions proxy penalty: `5.0`

The emissions proxy is a planning signal used by the optimizer; SUMO remains the source of measured fuel and CO2 results. The current tests validate the new objective and its behavior, but the weights still require calibration across multiple traffic scenarios to guarantee lower measured CO2 without sacrificing throughput or waiting time.

The network factory can scale beyond the bundled SUMO model. An 8x8 abstract network test produced 64 intersections, 224 roads, and 384 QUBO variables in 0.043 seconds. Running the hackathon demo with eight SUMO-controlled intersections is not currently supported because the bundled SUMO files define only `I1`-`I4`; the SUMO network files must be expanded before using `I5`-`I8` with `run_hackathon_demo.py`.

Validation completed on the `quantum-optimization` branch:

- 30 non-SUMO tests passed
- 11 SUMO integration tests passed
- Dashboard syntax and staged-diff checks passed
